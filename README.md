# The new podcast namespace
**`<rss version="2.0" xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0">`**

Since the [first podcast](https://blogs.harvard.edu/lydondev/2003/07/09/spoken-word-a-few-good-bloggers/) in 2003, the medium has been evolving.

Apple added [their own iTtunes podcast namespace in 2005](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements), extending the RSS specification to specify things like podcast artwork, categories and other elements.

In 2020, the new podcast namespace was first worked on by a wide number of interested people, aided and encouraged by Adam Curry and Dave Jones from The Podcast Index(https://podcastindex.org/). It is a set of new tags that are **100% backwards compatible** with existing podcast feeds. Like the Apple iTunes podcast namespace, the new podcast namespace adds additional features, like transcripts, locations, alternate audio files, and many more benefits for the open podcast ecosystem.

Individual tags are now supported by a growing number of podcast hosting companies and podcast apps.

## The full specification

The full specification for all the agreed tags is [described in this document](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md).

## This website

This website will be a place to give full examples of how to use the new podcast namespace tags. It is editable by the community; and you will also be able to use this to ask questions about implementation.

It's edited by James Cridland, the Editor of [Podnews](https://podnews.net); but anyone can submit their edits to make this resource better. If you'd like to help run the site, please contact James at james@crid.land
